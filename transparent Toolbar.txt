How to implement Transparent ToolBar ::
First You have to add a library for implementing this .
then Sync your project ...

After that ... in Styles file add a Custom theme

make the style parent NoActionBar (This is important)
and also make your AppTheme NoActionBar
DarkActionBar is a default value you have to change it to NoActionBar

----> See The difference ???
Now , Work with your  XML file .
Add AppBarLayout
include your toolbar Layout .

and that's all what you need to make your toolbar transparent 
but if you want your appbar to have some padding on top . 
then add another layout as parent of your appbarlayout and then add margine to your
AppBarLayout

So , here is our transparent Toolbar . if you ran it on your phone you will see the 
actual result ..


and do not use |  android:fitsSystemWindows="true" | in your XML 
Thank you ...
